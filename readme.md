# Colosseum

Hello World!

## Setup

1. Clone project to your directory
2. Navigate to scripts directory
3. Run build.bat with either Debug or Release (default)
4. Run Main.exe in bin directory

## TODO

- Allow for ComponentHandles to store type
	- Write translation (maybe in register component) to convert to bits
- Write a few components
- Hook up rendering to iterate over mesh/transform components
- Hook up physics to iterate over rigidbody components
- Look into archetype arrays instead of SoA
